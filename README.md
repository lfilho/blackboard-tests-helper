This is a little helper script to use on Blackboard.com platform.

# What
When doing multi-attempt exercises on the Blackboard.com plataform, you can take note of the right and wrong answers and then try again. This script will do that automatically for you so you save plenty of time in your quest for a better grade :wink:

# Usage

1. Put it into your "Snippets" tab on the Developer Tools of your browser.
2. Run in the first time on the "Review" page (after you submit your answers for the first time)
3. Run it again on the "Take" page (your second attempt...).
4. Smile
